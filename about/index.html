  <h2>Web Development</h2>
    <p>One of my main focuses is front-end web devlopment. I'm
    very intersted in learning about new web technologies and
    implementing them in my projects. I find figuring out how to
    implement design elements using CSS and HTML to be quite fun.</p>
  <h2>Blogging</h2>
    <p>I help run a technology blog called
    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tekaholics.com">TEKaholics</a>.
    On the blog, I do organizational work, edit articles, and
    write my own posts. I found working on the blog to be very
    enjoyable. It allows me to help writers get their messages
    across and gives me a place to voice my thoughts.</p>
  <h2>Piano</h2>
    <p>I started taking piano lessons five years ago. Often, after
    sitting at the piano, I find myself practicing for longer than
    intended. I play piano for my school choir and for a youth
    rock band, though I also enjoy playing pieces from the
    Classical and Romantic periods.</p>
