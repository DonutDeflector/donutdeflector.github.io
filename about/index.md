## General

I'm a high school junior with a deep interest in web development, biology and
music. During the summer of 2018 I had the opportunity to take BIOS S-1a and
CSCI S-33a at Harvard. I also performed Maple Leaf Rag on piano during the
Harvard Summer Session talent show. It was amazing to live so many of my 
interests for 7 weeks. I was able to learn so much from the experience and make
great, lasting friendships.

## Web Development

I've been learning web development since 2015. Other than CSCI S-33a, my web
development journey has been largely self-taught. I have experience with CSS
frameworks such as Bootstrap, Pure, and Spectre but I'm also completely
comfortable developing without a CSS framework. I'm comfortable using Vue on the
front-end and Django on the back-end. I primarily work with PostgreSQL as my
database and have experience deploying my projects to Heroku.

## Music

One of my most long standing hobbies is music. I've played the piano since 2012
and have been absorbed with music ever since. I play keyboard for my school's
choir and for a youth rock band, though I also enjoy playing ragtime and
Romantic era pieces. I occasionally produce trap and lo-fi hip-hop beats. My
musical taste is diverse and spans many genres. A few of my favorite musical
acts are Daft Punk, Kendrick Lamar, and Vulfpeck.
