      <p>My own personal website, which I made for fun.</p>
      <h3>Backstory</h3>
        <p>There have been a whole bunch of iterations of my website.
        Unfortunately, I don't have any screenshots of those prior versions.</p>
        <p>The first form of my website was a simple, single page using the
        Hack theme provided with github pages. It didn't look too shabby, gave
        some basic information on myself, and provided a few links to my
        accounts.</p>
        <p>I decided to make my own website from scratch, so using my minimal
        knowledge of HTML and CSS at the time, I made possibly the worst looking
        website under 200 lines of CSS. Well, maybe it wasn't completely
        terrible, but it definitely  was not going to win an award for design.
        It was based on a dark theme with the Brogrammer color scheme and was
        somewhat reminicient of 2000s 1337 haxxory. Bascially, the same as the
        first version of my site but signifigantly less attractive.</p>
        <p>The next edition of my website, made from scratch, actually didn't
        look too terrible. It actually scaled to mobile, unlike the last site,
        and had a sick navigation bar. The theme was dark, like the prior site,
        and was also based off of the same color scheme. I used Roboto condensed
        for the font, as it gave it a pretty awesome modern, trendy look.</p>
      <h3>Development</h3>
        <p>That all leads to the development of the newest verison of the site.
        After messing around with version three of the website and seeing what
        I could do to spiffy up the design, I decided that a complete rework
        was in order to give myself a clean base on which to base my design off
        of.</p>
        <p>I spent a lot of time looking at other
        <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Apersonal-website&type=Repositories">websites and blogs</a>
        run by web developers, designers, and programmers in an effort to
        <del>blatantly steal</del> draw inspiritation from them. I decided to
        use a minimal, simple design that still had a bit of flair and
        personality. That means parallax scrolling, thousands of animations, and
        10MB jQuery files are <b>not</b> allowed.</p>
        <h4>Color Palette</h4>
        <p>I employed the use of a few grayscale colors in my design, really
        giving my website the whole "minimal and hip" vibe. My main off-white
        is
        <code style="background-color:#D6DAE4;border:1px solid #212121;">#D6DAE4</code>
        with the main text color being
        <code style="background-color:#212121;color:#D6DAE4;border:none;">#212121</code>.
        I also used a light gray for less important text:
        <code style="background-color:#696969;color:#D6DAE4;border:none;">#696969</code>.</p>
        <p>As an accent color, I used a dark purple,
        <code style="background-color:#673AB7;color:#D6DAE4;border:none;">#673AB7</code>.
        I've also got a slightly more intense shade of purple, used for hover
        over effects and other interactivity stuff:
        <code style="background-color:#6200EA;color:#D6DAE4;border:none;">#6200EA</code>.</p>
        <h4>Layout</h4>
        <p>I settled on a pretty simple design: all content in a 768px scaling
        container with a fixed navigation bar on top, content in the middle,
        and footer at the bottom.</p>
        <p>Many people are probably appalled by the fact that I decided to use a
        768px container to house everything in. (And appalled by the fact that I
        write as if I was an arrogant, edgy teen trying to be funny.) Yes, I am
        aware that it is no longer 2005 and I must accomodate 100 inch 16K
        curved 21:9 displays. However, my layout (and all my content) fits quite
        tidily in 768px. Maybe some day I'll open up to the fact that 960px is
        probably a good practice. Maybe.</p>
        <h4>Tools and Work</h4>
        <p>Building this site was pretty much fiddiling with CSS styling and
        and doing a whole bunch of random experimentation. Through the process,
        I learned how to use a few new tools and optimize my site for mobile.</p>

        <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/">Google Web Fundamentals Documentation</a>
        in the process of building the website and learned how to implement a
        mobile-friendly design and respect a user's bandwidth. I'm still doing
        a whole bunch of work on the site: cutting down bloat, smoothing out the
        design, and thinking of new ideas.</p>
