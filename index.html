  visually appealing webpages.</p>

  <p>As a <span class="bold">programmer</span>, I aim to make somewhat useless,
  somewhat helpful scripts and stuff.</p>

  <p>As a <span class="bold">content creator</span>, I aim to make easy to
  follow and concise tutorials about Linux and open-source technologies.</p>
